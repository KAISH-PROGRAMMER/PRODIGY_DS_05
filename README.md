To analyze traffic accident data and identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, we need to follow these steps:
Data Preparation:
Collect and clean the traffic accident data.
Ensure the dataset includes information on road conditions, weather, time of day, and location.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of accidents across different categories (e.g., road conditions, weather, time of day).
Identify any missing values or anomalies in the dataset.
Pattern Identification:
Use statistical analysis to identify significant patterns and correlations.
Determine which factors are most strongly associated with accident frequency and severity.
Visualization:
Create visualizations to highlight accident hotspots and contributing factors.
Use maps to show geographical accident hotspots.
Use bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to illustrate patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
